astr330_stats01_CentralLimitTheorem_and_Gaussian.ipynb	
astr330_stats02_magnUncertainties.ipynb

## To run these: ##

These are Jupyter notebooks; opening the notebook in your browswer
should cause them to run. On a UNIX-like system (e.g. OS X Terminal), typing 

**jupyter notebook astr330_stats02_magnUncertainties.ipynb**

will open the notebook in your browswer. Under Windows, I think
double-clicking the notebook will cause it to launch.

## Required modules: ##

If when running these you get an error message like 

"module `numpy' not found"

then your computer doesn't yet have the required modules. The easiest
way to get these is simply to install the **anaconda** scientific
python distribution, which comes with **numpy**, **matplotlib**
etc. built-in. You can get **anaconda** for free from the following
link:

While I wrote these notebooks under python 2.7, they should work
without problems with python 3 .
